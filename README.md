## Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA in Python

This project explores time series forecasting using the ARIMA model implemented in Python. 

**What is ARIMA?**

ARIMA stands for Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average. It's a popular statistical technique for forecasting time series data. It utilizes three parameters (p, d, q) to capture different aspects of the data:

* **p (autoregressive):** The number of lagged values of the dependent variable to be included in the model.
* **d (integrated):** The number of times the data needs to be differenced to achieve stationarity (constant mean and variance over time).
* **q (moving average):** The number of lagged forecast errors to be included in the model.

**Project Steps**

1. **Data Collection:**
    * We'll use the Yahoo Finance API to collect historical Google stock prices (Open, High, Low, Close, etc.).
    * We'll focus on the "Close" price for forecasting purposes.

2. **Data Visualization:**
    * We'll visualize the closing prices to get a sense of trends and seasonality.

3. **Stationarity Check:**
    * ARIMA models require stationary data. We'll use techniques like seasonal decomposition to assess stationarity.

4. **Model Selection:**
    * If the data is not stationary, we'll use differencing (d parameter) to achieve stationarity.
    * If the data exhibits seasonality, we'll use the Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model, which incorporates a seasonal component into the ARIMA framework.

5. **Parameter Tuning (p & q):**
    * We'll employ techniques like autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots to determine the optimal values for p and q.

6. **Model Fitting:**
    * We'll use the statsmodels library to fit the ARIMA or SARIMA model to the data.

7. **Prediction:**
    * Once the model is fitted, we'll use it to predict future closing prices for a specified timeframe (e.g., next 10 days).

8. **Visualization:**
    * Finally, we'll plot the actual closing prices alongside the predicted values to visually assess the forecast accuracy.

**Key Takeaways**

* ARIMA is a powerful tool for time series forecasting, especially for relatively simple patterns.
* Identifying stationarity and seasonality is crucial for choosing the appropriate model (ARIMA or SARIMA).
* Parameter tuning (p & q) significantly impacts the model's performance.
